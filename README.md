# re.inform

## Project overview
re.inform is a project aimed at countering the spread of far-right extremism, fascism, racism, climate denialism, and other harmful ideologies online. Using a research-backed approach, we develop targeted counter-narratives based on personality categorization to promote critical thinking and reduce vulnerability to extremist content.

## Mission
Our mission is to better understand what leads certain people to fall for extremist or conspiracist content, and provide effective tools for engagement that can be used by various stakeholders working to combat harmful ideologies.

## Core features
- **Personality categorization**: Evidence-based classification of different personality types and their susceptibility to extremist content
- **Counter-narrative tools**:
  - Summary sheets for each personality category
  - Interactive chatbot that provides tailored conversation strategies
- **Community engagement**: Platform for contributors, users, and researchers to share insights and experiences

## Target audience
- Activists
- Educators
- Journalists
- Family/friends of individuals engaged with extremist content
- Political leaders

## Methodology
Our categorization framework is developed through:

- Integration of existing personality categorization methods
- Collaboration with leading social sciences researchers
- Digital "macroscope" mapping of online concepts and communities
- Community feedback and continuous improvement

## Technologies
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with potential React integration)
- **Backend**: Under evaluation (Node.js/Express or Python with Flask/Django)
- **Chatbot**: Large Language Model (LLM) implementation

## Current status
The project is in prototype development stage, with focus on building a functional "vitrine" website before scaling.
